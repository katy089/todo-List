# JS TODO List

Create a ToDo list using HTML, CSS, and JS only.

The application should have a `form` to create a new task setting the message and the due date of it.

After being created it should be listed below the `form` along with a `button` to mark it as complete.

There should also be a `select` with options to sort the list of tasks using its message, due date, creation date, and priority in both ascending and descending order.

The application should use semantic HTML and have your own CSS to style the list.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
